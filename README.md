# Analyzing three different sales strategies for a new line of products
A new line of office stationery products was launched and three different sales strategies were used for this over the last six weeks: targeted
email and phone calls, as well as combining the two.
**Email:** Customers in this group received an email when the product line was launched, and a
further email three weeks later. This required very little work for the team.
**Call:** Customers in this group were called by a member of the sales team. On average
members of the team were on the phone for around thirty minutes per customer.
**Email and call:** Customers in this group were first sent the product information email, then
called a week later by the sales team to talk about their needs and how this new product
may support their work. The email required little work from the team, the call was around ten
minutes per customer.

The goal is to provide compelling information to the sale department by answering this questions:
- How many customers were there for each approach?
- What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?
- Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?
- Based on the data, which method would you recommend we continue to use? Some
of these methods take more time from the team so they may not be the best for us
to use if the results are similar.
